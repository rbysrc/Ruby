“I Don't Even Care” many of us heard this sentiment anywhere from someone else. Binabanggit ito ng ilan sa kanilang mga kagalit at kung minsan naman ay sa atin mismo din ito nanggagaling. As a depraved human, innate na sa atin ang maging makasarili at hindi na natin ito kailangan pang aralin. Whether we utter those words or just kept in our thoughts, we can never deny them in the sight of God.
Even from the history may mga ilang samples sa Scripture na namuhay sa pagiging makasarili. Mula pa sa ating unang magulang na si Eve na natukso dahil sa pag iisip na mas magbubunga ng magandang benipisyo para sa kanya (i.e.Gen.3:6) na kung saan naging sanhi ng ating pagka hiwalay sa banal na Diyos. Si Cain na pumatay ng kapatid bunga ng kanyang pagiging makasariling pagdaramdam (i.e.Gen.4). Si haring Ahab na mas inuna ang pang sariling kaluguran bago ang magiging epekto sa kanyang mga nasasakupan (i.e.1 Kings 18:16-39). At marami pang iba.

Ang pagiging makasarili ng tao noon ay walang pagkakaiba sa ating henerasyon ngayon. Kung mayroon mang pagkakaiba ay isa narin siguro ngayon ang pag highlight ng depinisyon ng mundo na “self-care”. According to psychologytodaycom — Self-care may seem like nothing more than the latest buzzword or passing trend, but in reality, it is a commitment to ourselves—a promise to factor ourselves into the equation of our lives. When we optimize self-care, we feel better, look better, and have more energy. And quality self-care is linked to improved mental health, with benefits like enhanced self-esteem and self-worth, increased optimism, a positive outlook on life, and lower levels of anxiety and depression.

Obviously, that's the view of the world. It's all about me, myself & I. Nothing can help & no one can value me more than myself. What a selfish mentality! Of course, if you don't have God that's obviously your mindset. Pero kung ikaw na nagsasabing Christian ("Born Again" means you have a regenerated heart) at may ganyang mindset ay dapat mong tanungin ang iyong sarili kung ang iyong profession as a Christian ay totoo.
“Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test!” ~ 2 Corinthians 13:5

Ang solusyon ay self-examine at hindi self-care.
“For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.” ~ Philippians 2:21

For the last part let me also insert this message from David Padfield
...
The problem of self is neither new nor peculiar to our time. From Eden to eternity the chief cause of sin has been self and selfishness. It is at the root of all sin. "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death." (Jas. 1:13-15).

When it comes to sin, who is our biggest enemy? We might be quick to say that it is Satan. He is described in 1 Peter 5:8 as a "roaring lion" who walks about seeing whom he may devour. Actually, though, he can only overcome those who through self-will give themselves over to him. Someone has said, "To conquer self is to conquer all." We are prone to blame Satan and others but we must look to self.

The proper attitude toward self is a sign of maturity. We can somewhat condone selfishness in a child because he does not know better but immaturity and ignorance are never excuses for an adult, especially one who claims to be a Christian, to be selfish in his attitudes and actions (Acts 17:30).

I hope you will thoughtfully consider this article—for to be a successful Christian, one must heed the command of Jesus in Matthew 16:24, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me."
